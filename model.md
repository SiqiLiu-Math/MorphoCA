# Models for MorphoCA

Morphogenesis is a biological process in multicellular organisms that governs the development of shape and structure. 
This complex system includes molecular regulations, mechanical dynamics, and feedback from the shape and structure. 
People used Cellular Automata to model the molecular regulation, and use vertex models for the mechanical dynamics.
Here, we combine these models to study how organisms use simple rules to complete morphological tasks.

## Model structure

Cells are the units in the model.
